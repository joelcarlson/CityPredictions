# Markdowns

In this folder are several markdown documents which were developed during the creation of this project. They will hopefully provide insight into design decisions and the synthesis of ideas throughout the project.

The suggested order of browsing:

  1. [Defining and Investigating the Prediction Target](https://github.com/joelcarlson/CityPredictions/blob/master/markdowns/DefiningThePredictions.md)
  2. [Time Series Modeling](https://github.com/joelcarlson/CityPredictions/blob/master/markdowns/TimeSeriesModeling.md)
  3. [Gentrification Map Production](https://github.com/joelcarlson/CityPredictions/blob/master/markdowns/GentrificationMapProduction.md)
