    "  - Reorganized repo\n",
    "  - Built make file\n",
    "  - Finished extracting data from SLA HTML source files\n",
    "  - Mergeed latitude and longitude coordinates from zipcode R package\n",

    "    - Need to merge with liquor data\n",
    "  - Make final decision on what data to use\n",
    "    - Going to use liquor, food ins, amenities, and ZHVI to predict the year over year change in rent by area.\n",

Of course, you are thinking \"well obviously NY is a desirable palce to live\", well, wasn't NY a desirable place to live 5 years ago? (graph showing trend in diff between listing and selling, or mention ho this sint necessarily consistent all over NY). What are the factors that are leading to this? More importantly, can we predict whch areas of a city are most likely to experience price increases over and above regular inflation? \n",
