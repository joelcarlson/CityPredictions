    "  - Reorganized repo\n",
    "  - Built make file\n",

    "    - Merge zillow data with liquor data and amenity distance data\n",

Of course, you are thinking \"well obviously NY is a desirable palce to live\", well, wasn't NY a desirable place to live 5 years ago? (graph showing trend in diff between listing and selling, or mention ho this sint necessarily consistent all over NY). What are the factors that are leading to this? More importantly, can we predict whch areas of a city are most likely to experience price increases over and above regular inflation? \n",
